# R-Three-ForSpatialDataIndexing-sort-tile-recursive-STR-
The input file contains the coordinates 126437 rectangles which are MBRs of spatial objects. Each line of the file has the following format: object-id x-low x-high y-low y-high where object-id is the object identifier (integer), x-low is the lower limit of the rectangle in dimension x, x-high is the upper limit of the rectangle in the dimension x, y-low is the lower limit of the rectangle in the dimension y, and y-high is the upper limit of the rectangle in the dimension y. Write a program that implements the sort-tile-recursive (STR) technique to read the rectangles from the file and build an R-tree in memory for them. This technique first sorts all the rectangles based on their x-low value and then reads sections of the sorted list (or file) that correspond to the square root of the total number of leaves in the tree, sorts them by based on their y-low price and makes the leaves gradually (like the rest of the tree).
